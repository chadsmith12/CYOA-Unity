Introduction:

You awaken and eyes come open slowly. Everything looks very blury.
You struggle to see clearly, thought nothing looks familiar to you. You think to yourself, "where am I?"
You see a heart monitor, and see a nurse. You struggle to find your voice, you say...:

1: Where am I?
2: Who are you?
